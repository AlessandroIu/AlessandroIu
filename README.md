👋 Hi, my name is Alessandro Iudicone.  
👀 I love technology (coding, IT, hardware, graphic arts) but I'm also interested in sports (snowboard, windsurf, rollerskating and electric skates).  
🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and its environment for creating web services.  
💞️ I'm keen to share my interests and eventually collaborate on some project.  
📫 You can reach me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-iudicone/).
